# ffgcharsheets
The entire purpose is to have a range of character sheets for FFG games, since the ones available are is different states of construction. Additionally, I plan on having roll templates that can be added to spice up gameplay through macros. There will be two versions of each character sheet, one using the roll templates, and one using the default roll mechanics of roll20.
